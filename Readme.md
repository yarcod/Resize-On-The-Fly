---------------- HOW IT WORKS ----------------

This plugin will simply resize all images that are to be shown at the client. It catches the HTML content before
sending it and edits all image sources to a smaller sized version. This smaller image version will be cached and
created on the server, and will only be created once. 

In order to resize images, I have used Aqua Resizer (https://github.com/syamilmj/Aqua-Resizer). Credz!
